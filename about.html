		<h2>Welcome to KA Massage Therapy</h2>
		<p>I'm glad you're here! My name is Kevin Adams. I am a licensed massage therapist and a firm believer of accessible wellness for all. With this page, it is my goal to bring you the knowledge I have learned not only through Massage School and continuing education, but also from experience. I strive to help the people around me find a better quality of life.

<div id="aboutme2">
	<p>I am a licensed and insured massage therapist serving clients in Chester County, PA with extensive knowledge and experience in various massage therapy modalities and techniques proven to help people in pain. Some of my hands-on experience include Deep Tissue Massage, Swedish Massage, Sports Massage, and Structural Massage. Other skills include reflexology, postural assessment, and cupping therapy.<br><br>
In addition to my massage therapy training, I completed corporate training and certification for Isokinetic machines and exercises. Along the way I've developed coaching and reporting skills to monitor my client’s progress toward their health goals.

	<p>“Kevin was able to get me in last minute when I was in pain. He was very professional and his massage technique helped me so much. Very relaxing experience.”<br><br>

	<p>“After months and months of recovering from a sports injury, I decided it would be beneficial to try massage to relax my muscles and progress in feeling right. At KA massage Kevin was able to help me feel right working with my concerns and my recently operated on shoulder. I can’t thank Kevin enough for helping to make my body feel right again so I can get back to my passion of being an active young adult.”<br><br>
Andrew James<br>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
